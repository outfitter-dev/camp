# Handoff Formatting Guide

This guide provides the structure and formatting conventions for creating project handoff documents.

## Template Structure

Every handoff should follow this structure:

```markdown
# [Title of Change/Feature]

## Overview

[2-3 sentence summary of what was done and why it matters]

## Context

[Background information that led to this work] [Problem statement or
requirements] [Links to related issues/PRs if applicable]

## Key Changes

### 1. [Major Change Area]

[Description of what changed] [Why this approach was chosen]

### 2. [Another Change Area]

[Continue for all significant changes]

## Technical Details

### Architecture Decisions

```

## Writing Guidelines

1. **Be Specific**: Include file paths, function names, and concrete examples
2. **Explain Why**: Document not just what changed, but why decisions were made
3. **Think Future**: Write for someone (including yourself) reading this months
later
4. **Include Examples**: Show code snippets for complex changes
5. **List Commands**: Include any commands needed for migration or testing

## Common Sections

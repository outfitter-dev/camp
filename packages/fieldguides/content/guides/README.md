# Guides

If you only read ONE document about a topic, read these. Terse, comprehensive, opinionated, and prescriptive.

## What belongs here?

- Framework guides (e.g., `react-guide.md`, `nextjs-guide.md`)
- Technology guides (e.g., `typescript-guide.md`, `testing-guide.md`)
- Practice guides (e.g., `tdd-guide.md`, `security-guide.md`)

## Key characteristics

- **Terse** - shorter than the sum of related docs
- **Comprehensive** - covers all essential aspects
- **Opinionated** - strong defaults, clear recommendations
- **Action-oriented** - what to do, not just theory
- **Self-contained** - minimal need to reference other docs

## File naming

`<topic>-guide.md`

Examples:

- `react-guide.md`
- `testing-guide.md`
- `deployment-guide.md`

# or
pnpm add -g @outfitter/cli
```

## Commands

### `outfitter init`

```bash
outfitter init                    # Interactive setup
outfitter init --preset nextjs    # Use Next.js preset
outfitter init --with-claude      # Include CLAUDE.md for AI assistance
```

**Available presets:**

- `nextjs` - Next.js full-stack applications
- `react` - React single-page applications
- `node` - Node.js backend services
- `minimal` - Just TypeScript standards

### `outfitter add`

Add specific supplies to your project.

```bash
outfitter add react-patterns
outfitter add typescript-standards testing-standards
```

### `outfitter list`

List available supplies.

```bash
outfitter list              # Show all available supplies
outfitter list --installed  # Show only installed supplies
```

### `outfitter update`

Update supplies to their latest versions.

```bash
outfitter update          # Update all supplies
outfitter update --check  # Check for updates without installing
```

### `outfitter pack`

Manage supply configurations (packlists).

```bash
# Export current configuration
outfitter pack export
outfitter pack export --output team-standard.json

# Import a configuration
outfitter pack import team-standard.json
```

## Configuration

Projects initialized with Outfitter have a `.outfitter/` directory containing:

```
.outfitter/
├── config.json      # Project configuration and installed supplies
├── supplies/        # Local copies of installed supplies
└── cache/          # Version and update cache
```

### config.json

```json
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "preset": "nextjs",
  "supplies": [
    "typescript-standards",
    "react-patterns",
    "nextjs-patterns",
    "testing-standards"
  ],
  "installed": "2024-01-20T10:30:00Z"
}
```

## Packlists

Packlists allow you to share and standardize supply configurations across teams.

### Creating a Packlist

```bash
# Export your current setup
outfitter pack export --output frontend-standard.json
```

### Using a Packlist

```bash
# In a new project
outfitter init
outfitter pack import frontend-standard.json
```

### Packlist Format

```json
{
  "name": "Frontend Standard",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "supplies": ["typescript-standards", "react-patterns", "testing-standards"],
  "created": "2024-01-20T10:30:00Z"
}
```

## Available Supplies

### Standards

- `typescript-standards` - Core TypeScript patterns and conventions
- `testing-standards` - Comprehensive testing methodology
- `security-standards` - Security baseline and best practices
- `documentation-standards` - Clear documentation guidelines

### Patterns

## Integration with AI Assistants

Use the `--with-claude` flag during initialization to create a `CLAUDE.md` file
that references your installed supplies:

```bash
outfitter init --preset react --with-claude
```

This creates a CLAUDE.md that helps AI assistants understand your project's
standards and patterns.
